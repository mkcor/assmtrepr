## Reproducibility

Let us call the utility function `sessionInfo()` to print information about the
version of R we are running, the OS we are running, and the R packages we have
attached or loaded (see next section for a quick explanation).

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```


## Data Science with R

This [community of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice)
is very much fuelled by the talent and generosity of Hadley Wickham. For
reference, here are some recent resources:

* [Website for book "R for Data Science"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* [Tutorial video (October 10, 2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ss_ag2k9E)
* [Presentation video (November 18, 2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU0-NrUxRw4)

In a data science project, the first line of R code you would want to write and
run is

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

The [tidyverse](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/09/15/tidyverse-1-0-0/) is a
collection of R packages best suited for data exploration and analysis.
Metonymically, we call 'tidyverse' the community of practice around it. The
tidyverse leverages the expressive power of functional programming, which we try
to showcase in this notebook.

The previous line of code loads and attaches six packages (as the output reads).
We can check this by re-running

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

When a package is *attached*, we can call one of its functions directly. For
example, we can call `filter()` from package `dplyr`.

```{r}
filter(iris, Species == "setosa")
```

We were warned just earlier of a conflict: base package `stats` also has a
function named `filter()`. If we wanted to make sure that we are actually
calling the `filter()` function from `dplyr`, we would use the following syntax:

```{r}
dplyr::filter(iris, Species == "setosa")
```

This is a best practice. Indeed, we may end up copying and pasting this piece of
code elsewhere, where package imports are done in a different order...

When a package is simply *loaded* (and not attached), we have to prefix its
functions with the package name to call them. For example,

```{r}
assertthat::are_equal(0, 0.0)
```


## Original Analysis

The original analysis can be found under
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwPcvCxHVNBESlRfU3hmU0tsZkE
(file 'SoftwareCarpentry-Workshop-Evaluation.pdf').

Let us take a close look at the numbers in Table 1. The first paragraph of text
reads that 56 people were involved in the study (whether they took the
pre-workshop survey, the post-workshop survey, or both). A naive interpretation
of the column names (Table 1) suggests that this number can be recovered by
adding up all three numbers ('Pre only', 'Post only', 'Both Pre and Post'). But
this is not the case; e.g., we would have

```{r}
36 + 34 + 30
```

people for Michigan State University (MSU) alone... So it must be that 'Pre
only' (resp. 'Post only') does not mean "number of people who took *only* the
pre-workshop (resp. post-workshop) survey". Instead, it must be the total count
of people who took the pre-workshop (resp. post-workshop) survey, whether they
later (resp. first) took the post-workshop (resp. pre-workshop) survey as well
or not.

In this work, our first goal is to confirm the meaning of these column names. To
meet this goal, we reanalyze data to figure out which counts 36, 34, etc.
correspond to.

The raw data were communicated by Julie Libarkin via Titus Brown (Excel file
with four tabs, named: `PRE`, `POST`, `PRESPSS`, `POSTSPSS`). We exported the
`POSTSPSS` tab into a .csv file (for reference, Data Carpentry
[lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/05-exporting-data.htm). We renamed the file 'Software_Carpentry_SPSS_2012.csv'. We used LibreOffice,
keeping the default settings except for "cell formulas instead of calculated
values" (checked). The reasoning was that formulas would be easy to spot, so we
can later discard them, and recalculate them. So this should be helpful when
cleaning up and analyzing the data.

**TODO** Look up a way to do this export in the command line, to come up with a
more robust reproducible workflow.


## Data loading

Without further ado, let us load and attach our embryonic package:

```{r}
library(assmtrepr)
```

For now, this package does not come with any function... It only contains a
dataset (the above mentioned .csv export). Where can we find it?

```{r}
data_path <- system.file("extdata", "Software_Carpentry_SPSS_2012.csv",
                         package = "assmtrepr")
```

We can load this dataset with function `read_csv()` from `readr`. Let us retain
the name of the exported tab in the variable name:

```{r}
postspss <- readr::read_csv(data_path)
```

Let us get a feel for our data.

```{r}
postspss
```

A [tibble](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/03/24/tibble-1-0-0/) is a data
frame-like object. It comes with a neat print method (as you can see above).

Uh oh, some column names look unsafe... You would expect whitespaces to be
handled properly, but sometimes you run into
[issues](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/issues/244). Also, in R, the dollar
sign means something: It lets you access variables in a table (see above link on
'tibble'). So, really, variable name `$ cat hashbang` looks very unsafe.

## Data cleaning

What are all the column names?

```{r}
names(postspss)
```

Let us make all variable names syntactically valid, by calling the following
function from base R (the `base` package, if you like):

```{r}
names(postspss) <- make.names(names(postspss), unique = TRUE)
names(postspss)
```

Dots have replaced all special characters, because `.` is not syntactically
meaningful in R, although it is used within some conventions of certain
object-oriented systems (skip for now and for our purposes). Suffice it to say
that, in the tidyverse, we want to be safer and stricter, so we will replace
these dots with underscores:

```{r}
names(postspss) <- gsub("\\.", "_", names(postspss))
names(postspss)
```

(The double backslashes are about escaping characters which have a special
meaning in
[regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), in this
case, the dot).

**Note** We have used 'column name' and 'variable name' interchangeably.
Actually, a column is a variable only if the data are tidy. So, first, we should
ensure that each column is indeed a variable. If not, we should do the necessary
data wrangling.

Is there any empty column?

In R, the base function `is.na()` indicates whether an element is missing (or
null, although there is a difference, that we shall skip for now). For example,

```{r}
is.na(NA)
is.na(NaN)
is.na(0)
is.na("hola")
```

We shall use function `map()` (from `purrr`) to apply this function to all the
elements of our tibble: `map(postspss, is.na)`. Since, the output is large, let
us print only the first three elements:

```{r}
head(map(postspss, is.na), n = 3)
```

We are interested in those variables (columns) for which all elements are null
(empty columns). So we want to run: `map(map(postspss, is.na), all)`. This
nesting of functions must remind you of the mathematical style of function
composition. We can rewrite it in a piping style, which is more readable and
follows the order in which operations are performed:

```{r}
postspss %>%      # Take our dataset,
  map(is.na) %>%  # pass it to function map() with argument is.na,
  map(all) %>%    # pass the result to map() with argument all,
  head()          # and only output the first six elements.
```

The pipe operator `%>%` comes with the `dplyr` package. Since `names(postspss)`
is a vector, we would like to get a vector, not a list. Looking up the
[docs](https://github.com/hadley/purrr#transformation) for `purrr`, we happily
find the `map_lgl()` function.

```{r}
empty_col <- postspss %>%
  map(is.na) %>%
  map_lgl(all)

empty_col %>%
  head()
```

Let us check that they are all non-empty:

```{r}
which(empty_col)
```

As you now know, we could have run `empty_col %>% which()` alternatively. Since
we do not have empty columns, we will have to wait to showcase
`postspss %>% select(...)` or `postspss %>% select_(...)` for column selection.

Is there any empty row?

```{r}
postspss %>%
  transpose() %>%
  map(is.na) %>%
  map_lgl(all) %>%
  which()
```

No. Again, we will have to wait to showcase `postspss %>% filter(...)` for row
selection.

## Split-Apply-Combine

Reference: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01/

```{r}
postspss %>%
  group_by(Location) %>%
  tally()
```

So, *assuming* each row is an observation (which is the case in tidy data) and
each observation is a person who participated in the survey, we have 40 people
from MSU and 17 from UTA, which totals 57 (not 56).

**TODO** Troubleshoot this difference of 1.
